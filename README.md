Using Swift and Xcode's StoryBoard UI designer, I've had the chance to create my first mobile iOS app. Comprised of the Main Menu, the Game Screen, and the Statistics Screen, WhosThatMDB is meant to help any new members of a large organization remember the faces and names of their fellow club members in a fun, interactive way. Through this app, any users from any organization can make memorizing names an easy, fun task! Although many parts aren't still complete and the UI could be significantly improved, give it a go!
