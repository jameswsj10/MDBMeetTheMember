# WhosThatMDB

## Creating a Trivia Game app to help remember names of club members

Using Swift and Xcode's StoryBoard UI designer, I've had the chance to create my first mobiel iOS app. 
Comprised of the Main Menu, the Game Screen, and the Statistics Screen, WhosThatMDB is meant to help any new members of 
a large organization remember the faces and names of their fellow club members in a fun, interactive way. Although many parts
aren't still complete and the UI could be significantly improved, give it a go!
